## About myself
Although I graduated as an IT technician in 2018, I didn’t get the chance to start a full-time career in the field. Still, I’ve always tried to stay connected with IT — building websites, creating chatbots, and writing small programs to make my daily tasks easier. Over time, I’ve realized that programming genuinely inspires me, and I’ve made a personal commitment to develop solid, lasting skills to work professionally as a developer in the future.

One of my strengths is creativity. While this might not always seem ideal in roles focused strictly on implementation, for me, creativity is what keeps me motivated and helps me avoid burnout. I believe this quality allows me to bring fresh ideas and long-term passion to my work as a programmer.

## Code Example

```
function numCombo(arr, num){
  const sum = arr.reduce((a, b) => a + b)
  return arr.filter(x => sum - x == num).length;
}
```

## Experience
My first project was a small **Bookstore** website focused mainly on functionality rather than design. Through this project, I learned how to work with Git, create and query a database, and implement basic CRUD operations and search functionality. It helped me understand the foundation of backend logic and version control.
